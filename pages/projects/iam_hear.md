**I.M.Hear** is a tabletop interface with mobile devices. The interface is based on the TAPIR Acoustic Locator (TAL) â€“ a location system for mobile devices using barely audible sound: positions of the mobile devices on the table are tracked down in real time with acoustic signals only. There is a virtual scan line (moving from left to right) on the surface of the table; each device displays part of the scan line when it is "touched" (as shown in the video below) to provide visual feedback to the user.
I participated in this project as a sound designer. Surrounding sounds, such as ambient noise or the users' voice, are recorded through an external microphone and manipulated/re-arranged using Max/MSP to produce their pitch-shifted versions.
